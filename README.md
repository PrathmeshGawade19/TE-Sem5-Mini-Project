Project Overview
The Virtual Painter is an interactive drawing application that uses hand-tracking technology to allow users to create digital art simply by moving their hands. Built with Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and NumPy, this project enables real-time drawing on a virtual canvas, making it a fun and creative tool for users of all ages.

Features
Hand Tracking: Utilizes MediaPipe to detect hand movements and gestures, allowing intuitive drawing and interaction.
Brush and Eraser: Choose between different brush sizes and an eraser tool to create or remove drawings easily.
Color Selection: Offers a palette of colors to choose from, enabling users to customize their artwork.
Clear Canvas: A one-click option to reset the canvas and start a new drawing.
Responsive UI: Interactive buttons for color selection, pen size adjustments, and toggling the visibility of the canvas and tools.
Technologies Used
Python: The programming language used for developing the application.
OpenCV: A library for computer vision that helps with image processing and video capturing.
MediaPipe: Used for hand detection and tracking, enabling real-time interaction.
NumPy: A library for numerical operations, essential for handling image data.

Usage
Launch the application, and a window will open displaying your webcam feed.
Use your fingers to draw on the canvas:
Index Finger Up: Draw with the selected brush color.
Two Fingers Up: Erase with the eraser tool.
