# TE-Sem5-Mini-Project
A real-time virtual painter using hand gestures. Built with OpenCV, MediaPipe, and NumPy, it tracks hand movements to let users draw on a canvas, select colors, change brush sizes, and use an eraser. The application offers an interactive drawing experience by recognizing finger positions to control the brush, making drawing fun and intuitive.
